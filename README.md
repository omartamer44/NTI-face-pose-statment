### Face Pose Estimation Project

This project involves developing a system to determine the direction a person's face is looking in a photograph. By analyzing images, the system estimates whether a face is turned left, right, up, or down. This has practical applications in fields like augmented reality and facial recognition, enhancing user experiences by accurately tracking gaze direction and improving identification accuracy.

To achieve this, we collected a diverse set of images featuring faces at various angles and used advanced image processing techniques. The project explored both traditional machine learning and modern deep learning methods to train the system. A user-friendly interface was also developed for real-time face pose estimation.

This work was completed as part of our graduation requirements at the National Training Institute (NTI), showcasing our skills in computer vision and machine learning. It highlights the practical applications of this technology in everyday life.
